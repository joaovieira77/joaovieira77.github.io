        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is João, I'm 23 years old and I was born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal. <br>
          Technology has always been a big part of my life. I wrote my first lines of code back in 2018 during my final year of high school, and since then, I've been exploring and experimenting with programming — sometimes intensely, sometimes at my own pace.</p>

      <div class="hobbies">
        <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Outside of tech, football takes a big part in my life. I love the tactical side of the game and really enjoy analyzing matches from a strategic point of view. I also follow other sports like handball, Formula 1, hockey, American football, and more. <br>

          I'm also a gamer and love diving into different styles of games. My favorites include Counter-Strike, Valorant, Football Manager, FIFA, Call of Duty, and The Witcher. I'm very competitive and I enjoy the mix of skill and strategy. <br>
          I also enjoy spending time cooking, going for drives, and reading books. These moments help me reset. <br>
          For a few years now, I've also been diving deeper into psychology. The human mind really intrigues me—how we think, make decisions, and what drives our behavior in different situations.</p>
